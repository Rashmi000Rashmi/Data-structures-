Welcome to our repository for practicing data structures and algorithms, aimed at preparing us for the job market. We are following the NeetCode Roadmap: https://neetcode.io/roadmap as our guide for learning and mastering these topics. Our goal is to solve two questions each day, though on days when we're focused on learning new concepts, we may skip the daily questions to deepen our understanding.

# Instructions

## Branch Creation
Each member should create their own branch to work on their code.  
**Branch naming convention:** `name_branch` (e.g., `bob_branch`).

## Daily Folders
For each day, there will be a folder named `Day_01`, `Day_02`, etc. Inside each daily folder, you'll find a `README.md` file listing the two questions to be solved that day.

## File Creation
Each member should create their own file within the appropriate day’s folder.  
**File naming convention:** `name_dayNumber_questionNumber` (e.g., `bob_01_1`).

## Additional Contributions
Members are encouraged to share insights or document what they learned while solving the questions.

## Task Completion
If you are unable to complete the day’s tasks, please provide a brief explanation for why the task was not completed.
