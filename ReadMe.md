Welcome to our repository for practicing data structures and algorithms, aimed at preparing us for the job market. We are following the NeetCode Roadmap: https://neetcode.io/roadmap as our guide for learning and mastering these topics. Our goal is to solve two questions each day, though on days when we're focused on learning new concepts, we may skip the daily questions to deepen our understanding.
